"PDF Mapper", a Java-based software designed to streamline the process of extracting form data from multiple, 
highly specific PDF files and loading it into an Excel spreadsheet.

PDF Mapper simplifies the task by allowing users to select multiple PDF files from a directory and specify which form fields to extract data from. 
Using Apache PDF Box 2.0.27, PDF Mapper effectively parses the PDF files and extracts the relevant form data, 
while Apache POI 5.2.0 is utilized to write the data directly into an Excel spreadsheet.

To ensure optimal user experience, PDF Mapper has a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) 
that enables users to easily select the input directory and specify the output file path for the Excel spreadsheet. 
Once the user has selected the desired PDF files, they can initiate the extraction process by clicking on the "Create Spreadsheet" button.

This project has been specifically designed to address a tedious and repetitive task, and thus is tailored to accommodate the specific needs of the intended task.
